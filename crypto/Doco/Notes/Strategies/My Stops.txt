Attached is a CSV of a bunch of XRP tokens. My current strategy is outlined below. Give me a summary of performance. How many tokens were assessed? How many were bought? If bought, at what stop were they sold? What was the return?

Buy logic: 
If the price doubles in within the first 15 mins buy it is purchased immediately.  
A token will only be bought once

Stop 1 = buy price was between 15% and 150%
Stop 2 = buy price was between 25% and 180%
Stop 3 = buy price was between 40% and 200%
Stop 4 = buy price was between 55% and 225%
Stop 5 = buy price was between 110% and 300%
Stop 6 = buy price was between 175% and 390%
Stop 7 = buy price was between 295% and 500%
Stop 8 = buy price was between 400% and 600%
Stop 9 = buy price was between 500% and 700%
Stop 10 = buy price was between 600% and 800%
Stop 11 = buy price was between 700% and 900%

Stop Logic:
As the token price rises and exceeds a stop's upper limit, the lower limit of the next stop becomes the new sell threshold.
If the price falls below the current stop's lower limit, sell the token.
Tokens can only enter a stop once. The token either progresses to the next stop by surpassing the current stop's upper limit or is sold when it falls below the current stop's lower limit.
If the price exceeds the final stop's upper limit, sell automatically at that level.
