	[ Before you begin ]
1. You will need an Xaman wallet. 
	Technically it doesn't have to be Xaman, but it must have a secret in this format '261821 261821 261821 261821 261821 261821 261821 261821' as oppsoed to the mnemonic words or the shorter S**** secret number.

2. Set up a Telegram public chat. 
	The bot will be added to this chat, it is how you'll receive alerts.

	[ TROUBLE SHOOTING ]
** Telegram **
Telegram is a critical peice of infrastructure for this solution. 
The bot is using a paid API which improves stability dramatically however since development has begun Telegram has had two outages so I would say it is a common problem.
The status of Telegram can be checked here: https://downdetector.com.au/status/telegram/
Downed APIs are not a solvable problem, if Telegram is down, just wait it out.
