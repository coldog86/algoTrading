combined.csv is a bunch of crypto tokens. 
Each token name represents a descret token. They can not be traded with each other.

Create the following strategies: 

Basic strategy: 
If the current price is 5% lower than the previous price, it generates a buy signal (provided no position is already held for that token).
If the current price is 8% higher than the previous price, it generates a sell signal.

Bollinger Bands strategy with the following parameters: 
Rolling window: 50
Standard deviation multiplier: 6 

Moving Average strategy using these parameters:
Short window: 20-period 
Long window: 100-period 

MACD strategy using these parameters:
Short Window: 73
Long Window: 98
Signal Window: 63

Combined Strategy: 
Only buy when all three strategies (MACD, Moving Average, Bollinger Bands) generate a buy signal. 

For all strategies apply the following rules:
Use a fixed outlay of $10 per buy, starting with an opening balance of $100
Include a rule that Prevent additional buy signals if the strategy already holds the token.
Factor in a slipage of 5% per trade. 

Back test the combined strategy and show me the results, include number of trades, include ROI and total ROI
Show results to 3 decimal places
