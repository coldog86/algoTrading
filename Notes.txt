[Definitions of Trading Terms]
  [Golden Cross]
    Golden Cross is when the 50 day moving average crosses above the 200 day moving average.
    This means the recent average price is higher then it's long term average price and tends to mean a bullish market.

  [Death Cross]
    Oposit of Golden Cross. 
    When the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200 day moving average.

  [Whip saw]
    Quick back and forths between up and down swings. 
    Using smaller numbers as your moving averages when looking for Golden or Death Crosses. 

  [Relative Strength Index]
    An indicator used to measure a stock's momentum (speed and size of the price changes).
    Can be used to determin if a stock is OverBought or OverSold. 
        RS = Avg Gains / Avg Losses

  [OverBought]
    Has increased rapidly in a short period of time and may see a reversal.
    Often an RSI of 70+ is considered OverBought.

  [OverSold]
    Has decreased rapidly in a short period of time and may see a reversal.
    Often an RSI of -30 is considered OverSold.

  [Divergence]

[EMA vs SMA]
Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is similar to Simple Moving Average (SMA), measuring trend direction over a period of time. However, whereas SMA simply calculates an average of price data, EMA applies more weight to data that is more current.
Since EMAs place a higher weighting on recent data than on older data, they are more reactive to the latest price changes than SMAs are, which makes the results from EMAs more timely and explains why the EMA is the preferred average among many traders.
